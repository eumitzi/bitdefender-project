# bitdefender-project

Our project tries to provide the user with a web-based anti-malware tool.

## Getting Started

I really don't know how to deploy this but we will use Docker.

### Prerequisites

You need to have python 3 installed, and I don't know what more, we need to talk. Also you will need to install the necessary modules with the following comand.

```
pip install requirements
```

### Installing

Absolutely no idea.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Then something more.

```
shutdown now
```

### Tests

For the server:
```
# This "installs" the code.
# This means you'll be able to import your code, regardless of your current active directory.
pip install -e server
```

```
# Now let's run the tests:
pytest
```
